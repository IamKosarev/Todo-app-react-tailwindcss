# React & Tailwind Todo App

> In this project I integrated Tailwind CSS with React and built a simple Todo App

## Technologies

- React 17.0.1
- Tailwind CSS 2.0.4
- Postcss 7.0.35
- Autoprefixer 9.8.6
- Uuid: 3.4.0
- Craco 6.1.1

## Features

- Add your todos
- Switch between active and completed tabs
- Delete completed todos
- The data is stored in local storage so when you refresh the page you can still see your todos
